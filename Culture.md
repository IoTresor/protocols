5 Types of Company Culture

Star: organisations recruit the most talented people, may pay them the most and then hope that cumulatively their efforts will be bigger than the sum of their parts. The evidence shows that when this works, it’s spectacular, but when it fails, it’s also likely to be spectacular.

Autocratic: organisations may be dominated by one powerful leader, sometimes the founder, who totally dominates what people do and how they behave. Without them the culture becomes dysfunctional.

Bureaucratic: organisations are run by middle management, often based on policy, procedures, rules and regulations.

Engineering: organisations recruit technically brilliant people. People become attached and buy in through challenging work and the influence of peer group control.

Commitment: organisations who build a culture based on commitment, building an emotional tie between the organisation and employees, have far less likely to fail (see chart below from the Stanford research). Retention is higher at these organisations, too.
